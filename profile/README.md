# Zuspec - An Action Relation Level Modeling Framework
Zuspec provides a set of tools for working with action relation level
(ARL) models, primarily those described using the 
[Accellera Portable Test and Stimulus (PSS)](https://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/portable-stimulus) language. ARL models are used today to
specify system-level tests for digital designs, but they lend themselves
to many more applications as well. Zuspec has a very modular design to support
rapidly exploring new applications for this modeling methodology.
